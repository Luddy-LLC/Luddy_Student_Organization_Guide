# Developing an Online Presence
It is recommended that all groups have at least one central page online in addition to
their beINvolved page updated with all current information and events. This can take the
form of one or more social media accounts, a website, or both. Social media accounts are
typically quicker to set up and provide enough functionality for brand new student
groups, but websites can be a great option for more established student groups.
