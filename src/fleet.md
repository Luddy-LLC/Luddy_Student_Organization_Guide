# Using the IU Fleet Service

Using the IU Fleet Service
If your event requires travel outside of Bloomington, it may be a good idea to use a vehicle from the IU Fleet Service.

To use a Fleet Service vehicle, reach out to the Office of Insurance, Loss Control & Claims (INLOCC)
- email: [INLOCC@iu.edu](mailTo:INLOCC@iu.edu)
- phone: [812-855-9758](tel:+1-812-855-9758)  

INLOCC will assist you with creating a
Fleetcommander profile. Once your Fleetcommander profile is created, your faculty sponsor will be able to request vehicle(s) for your student group.

For a list of vehicles offered by the IU Fleet Service and their rates, see [here](https://fleetservices.indiana.edu/vehicle-rental/available-rental-vehicles.html)
