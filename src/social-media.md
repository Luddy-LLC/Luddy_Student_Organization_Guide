# Social Media
## [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)
LinkedIn is the most prominent social media website exclusively for the
professional sphere. Like other platforms, it allows for the posting of text,
videos, and images. Because it is predominantly used for networking and
recruitment, individual’s profiles are inaccessible by default unless they
have ‘connected’ with your account.  
- Your IU account includes free access to LinkedIn Learning, formerly known
as Lynda.com. It hosts a wide variety of professional development tutorials,
some of which will be referenced in this guide.

## TikTok
TikTok is a short-form video platform that allows users to create and share
engaging content with a wide audience. It is particularly useful for student
organizations looking to promote events, share highlights, and engage with
members through creative and interactive videos.
- With TikTok’s trending sounds, challenges, and hashtag system, student
groups can increase their visibility and attract new members. The platform
is ideal for showcasing behind-the-scenes footage, event recaps, and fun,
engaging content relevant to your organization’s mission.

- Note: It is NOT recommended to engage in paid social media advertising for your student group, but leveraging organic reach through trending challenges and collaborations can be highly effective.

## [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)
Instagram is a platform that allows users to post stories, short videos, and
stories (posts that stay on the profile for 24 hours). The platform
emphasizes visual storytelling and can be a great place to share flyers for
upcoming events/meetings as well as photos from after events/meetings.

## Facebook
Facebook is a social media platform that allows users to share text posts,
photos, videos (short and long), and event information. While Facebook has
the capability for stories and reels like Instagram, they are less frequently
utilized by users. Compared to Instagram, Facebook’s demographics skew
slightly older. For student groups, Facebook’s main strength is its event
sharing capabilities.
