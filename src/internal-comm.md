# Establishing Internal Communication

## Email Lists
Creating an email list allows you to easily email your group’s membership
and masse by typing in a single address.
For information on how to create a group on Outlook, see:

## Discord
Discord is a platform that allows users to create servers that function as
text, video, and voice chat spaces with highly customizable channels. While
the platform was initially designed for gaming, it has become extremely
popular across a wide range of demographic populations and is a common
choice for communication within student groups. However, because the
platform is so feature-rich, it does have a steeper learning curve than many
of the other internal communication options.

## GroupMe
GroupMe is a group text platform that allows the creation of group chats
that can be used across any phone and computer platforms users may have.

## Remind Texts
Remind is a service that allows users to send text message reminders to
multiple recipients at once. While this service is great for reminding
members about upcoming meetings and events, it does not allow for group
communication between members. So, it is best to pair Remind with
another platform that allows for group communication to help build
community in your student group.
