# Budgets and Submitting Budgets
**All Luddy organizations are sponsored through the Office of Student Engagement and Success.**  
Student organizations must submit their budgets for approval each semester. Deadlines and submission details are shared via email or during Presidents Meetings, hosted by the Office of Student Engagement and Success. These can be submitted by emailing [lsg@iu.edu](mailTo:lsg@iu.edu) or by [submitting to the LSG form](https://forms.office.com/r/SiihyFkYn4).
