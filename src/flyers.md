# Flyers
Handing out flyers to classes can be a great way to give individuals a physical reminder about your shoutout after class time ends. The flyer should reiterate the same information said in your [shoutout](class-shoutouts.md) and/or provide a link to a page that has
that information.

Please note that Self-Governed Student Organizations (SGSOs) are not permitted to use
Indiana University’s trademarks, symbols, logos, mottoes, or depictions of campus
buildings and landmarks. There is an official SGSO logo available [here](https://studentlife.indiana.edu/get-involved/student-organizations/manageorganization/promote-organization.html).
