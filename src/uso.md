# Registering your Student Organization as an USO

Registering your student group as a University Student Organization (USO) with IU Bloomington’s Student Involvement office is not required. However, registering your student group does have a variety of benefits, including the ability to apply for university funding. For more information on how to register your student group as a USO and a complete list of benefits to registering, see [here](https://studentlife.indiana.edu/involvement-belonging/student-involvement-leadership/student-organizations/create/index.html)
 

### The requirements for initially registering as an USO are as follows[^note]: 
#### Register on BeINvolved 
  - BeINvolved is an online service that allows student groups/organizations to maintain a profile that is easily accessible by the Indiana University network. Here, your organization can post events and information as well as utilize discussion boards and group messaging. This resource also allows you to showcase what you are doing as an organization by posting your activities, campus involvement, collaborations, etc. beINvolved also organizes events, organizations, and articles for other groups to view and attend on campus. 
  - Tutorials on navigating beINvolved can be found [here](https://engagesupport.campuslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016011492- Student-Leader-Resource-Guide)  

#### Have at least one faculty/staff advisor listed on your beINvolved roster who is employed by Indiana University (cannot be an undergraduate student). 

#### Have at least five enrolled IU Bloomington student members. 

#### Meet with the Student Organization Registration Committee (if necessary)
- Submit a Budget to the Office of Student Engagement and Success  

#### Write a constitution 
  - Constitution requirements [adapted from the “Constitutions” section](https://studentlife.indiana.edu/involvement-belonging/student-involvement-leadership/student-organizations/create/index.html): 
  - All student organizations must create and maintain a constitution. A constitution contains the fundamental principles which govern an organization's operation. The development of a constitution will serve to clarify your purpose and delineate your basic operating structure. It will also allow current and potential members to have a better understanding of what the organization is all about. 
  - These clauses MUST appear exactly as written in EVERY student organization constitution: 
    - Statement of University Compliance: This organization shall comply with all Indiana University regulations and local, state, and federal laws. 
    - Anti-Hazing Policy: Hazing is strictly prohibited. Hazing shall be defined as any conduct which subjects another person, whether physically, mentally, emotionally, or psychologically, to anything that may endanger, abuse, degrade, or intimidate the person as a condition of association with a group or organization, regardless of the person’s consent or lack of consent. 
    - Personal Gain Clause: This organization, if raising funds, shall ethically raise and distribute profits from organizational functions to either the organization or to members who provide a service that directly benefits the organization. Individual members may not receive compensation from for-profit companies if acting as a representative of a student organization. 
  - The following clauses may also be required based on your organization's activities: 
    - Programs Involving Children: This organization, when working with children, will be aware of and abide by the university's Programs Involving Children (PIC) Policy. 
    - International Travel: This organization, when traveling internationally, will coordinate their travel through the Office of Overseas Study.
