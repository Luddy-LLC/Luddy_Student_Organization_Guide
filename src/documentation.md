# Maintaining Internal Documentation
It is essential that your student group has a way to keep any documents you use organized and backed-up to a cloud-based service. This not only ensures that documents are accessible and secure, but it also makes the transition of power after elections far easier. A few document storage and sharing solutions commonly used by student groups are listed below:

- Microsoft Teams
  - Microsoft Teams is IU’s main supported collaboration tool. It allows organizations to share files, work on documents simultaneously, and chat internally.

- Microsoft SharePoint
  - Microsoft SharePoint is a platform that allows for maintenance of shared file repositories. A ‘site’ is created on which to host files, which can be held under various levels of permission.
