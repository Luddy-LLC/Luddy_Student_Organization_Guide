# Annual To-Do's

## Submitting Budgets
All student Orgs need to submit their budgets semesterly for approval to the office of student engagement.

## Updating beINvolved and Member Roaster
You need to update beINvolved with the current board and board members.


## Student Involvement Fairs
All groups must attend at least one (both recommended) student involvement fair. IU hosts one fair in August and one in January of each academic year. Information about each semester’s involvement fair is [typically posted on BeInvolved a few months in advance](https://beinvolved.indiana.edu/events)

Students are also encouraged to set up a table each year at the ILS Fall Orientation as well as Luddy Red carpet days to promote their organization/group to incoming students.

## Elections
While there are no formal requirements for student group elections, it is recommended that your student group hold elections for all executive board positions (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, etc.) once per academic year.  

Typically, student group elections involve a nomination period, where any member of the organization can recommend themselves or any other organization members for one or more board positions. The nominees are then allowed to accept or reject the nomination before being put on the election ballot. Once all nominees have responded, the ballots are
sent out to all members of the group for voting. When the voting period has concluded, the votes are tallied, and whichever candidate has the most votes is offered the position they ran for.  

Most student groups use a virtual form that collects anonymous responses as their election ballots. Some tools for creating forms for elections can be found below:
- [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)
  - Google Forms is one of several free tools available in Google Drive. It allows individuals to create surveys with a variety of response types and automatically compiles responses. It is particularly useful for organizations who use Google Drive to manage their internal documentation as surveys created in Google Forms can be saved to Google drive folders.
