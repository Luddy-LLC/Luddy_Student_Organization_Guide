# P-Card
*A P-Card (Procurement Card) is a university-issued credit card used for purchasing approved goods and services outlined in your organization’s approved budget.*

## Who Can Use a P-Card 

Each user must complete P-Card training before use.

Authorized users include: 

- Professional Staff: [Tiana Iruoje](mailTo:tiwillia@iu.edu), [Nicole Mitchell](mailTo:nmitch@iu.edu), [Courtland Crenshaw](mailTo:cccrensh@iu.edu), [Jan Questelles](mailTo:jaquest@iu.edu), [Wodsander Maxime](mailTo:wodmaxim@iu.edu), and [Reece Needham](mailTo:reeneedh@iu.edu). 
- Student Organization Officers: Treasurer[^note] 

[^note]The only officers that are permitted to submit requests in the Treasurer's temporary absence (e.g., illness, etc) are the President and Vice President of the student organization. This does not apply to situations where a Treasurer has not been appointed—**a Treasurer must be appointed at all times**. Prior communication and authorization by [Luddy Student Government](mailTo:lsg@iu.edu) are required before any officer acts in the Treasurer’s place. 

## Requesting a P-Card 
Once your organization's budget is approved, you can begin submitting P-Card requests for events. 
- P-card Requests must be submitted at least three weeks before the event date. 
- As of Fall 2025, the p-card request form is available at the top of the Clubs and Organizations channel in Luddy Student Government Teams Channel, or through the Luddy Student Government Sharepoint Page.  

## After submitting a P-Card request: 
A member of the Office of Student Engagement and Success will contact you to either:
- Confirm your request and next steps.  
- Deny your request based on incorrect fields, structure, or failure to follow guidelines
