# Additional Tips for Running a Successful Organization
## Make Your Meetings Interesting/Appealing
Host speakers, provide food, make it a
potluck, play ice breaker get-to-know-you games. This will not only boost club morale, but it will also keep attendance high and help recruit new members. Also, student organizations are innately social, so enjoy yourselves while you promote your common interests!

## Create and Maintain Active Websites and/or Social Media
By doing this, you can showcase what you’ve done in the past as well as post and update events, ideas, and message boards for students to have a go-to place for all important and interesting
information. You can appoint a member of your club, or you can make the page
collaborative and allow all members to post. Just make sure to keep it up to date, fun, and interesting!

## Take Full Advantage of All Funding Opportunities
This will allow you to host more
events, create some savings in your SOA account for a rainy day, travel, and collaborate with other organizations.


## Sell swag! 
Get creative and create and sell apparel that people want to use/wear. This is a
great way to show your presence on campus, build camaraderie with a team look, and recruit new members. [Underground Printing](https://undergroundshirts.com/locations/indiana/bloomington), located on Kirkwood Ave. in Bloomington
is a good starting point for creating custom designs. They work well with Indiana University affiliates, have a brilliant design team, and sell at reasonable prices

## Program, Program, Program
Be ACTIVE. Collaborate with other groups, bring in speakers, travel to other schools, host panels, the list goes on. This is one of the best parts
of student organizations: you get to have fun, learn, and spread the love. Come speak to us for examples of events if you are stuck. 

## Ask Your Members What They Want! 
It takes a team to tango, and without knowing what all members want, well… there’s no dance floor. Take advantage of survey monkey to gather data on opinions and to help make decisions between ideas. Give everyone a
voice in your organization and extend this campus wide – find out what your community needs. How can you give back to the communities you care for?

## Maintain Documents for Future Officers. 
This is incredibly important for smooth transitions when executive members change. This is also a common courtesy to help your successors pick up where you left off. A great way to maintain a thorough history of your activities, plans, goals, and finances is to take meeting minutes and set up appropriate
documents for each member of your executive board to maintain.

## Meet With Your Executive Board Frequently! 
This will help create a vision for you and your members and will allow you to remain organized and able to facilitate group meetings efficiently.
