# Class Shoutouts
During the first few weeks of the semester, it is highly recommended that leaders from student groups advertise their student groups in classes in order to help recruit new members.  

There are two options for how your student group can do a class shoutout. First, a representative from your student group’s leadership team can make an announcement at the start/end of class. Second, if a member of your student group’s leadership team is
unable to be at the class to do the shoutout, you can reach out to the professor of the course and ask if they would be willing to talk about your group at the start/end of class. If you opt for this option, it is recommended that you have a prepared statement written out for the professor to read off of.

You should always reach out to the professor of the course you’re doing a shoutout in well before the semester begins. Be sure to explain what student group you represent, how that student group’s work relates to the course you’re hoping to do a shoutout in, and what week/class session you were hoping to do the shoutout.

When doing your in-class shoutout, it is recommended to include the following
information:
- The name of your student group
- The mission/purpose of your group
- Your group’s meeting schedule
- Information on any upcoming events
- Your group’s social media pages and/or website
- Next steps students can take to get more involved
  - Ex. Joining the beINvolved, following the group’s social media account(s), joining the group’s Discord/email list
- Try to have a QR code and/or Bitly link set up so students can take out their devices and join your organization right away rather than having to remember to do it later!
  - Both bitly links and QR codes can be set up on the Bitly website for free. For more information, visit the [Bitly Help Center](https://support.bitly.com/hc/en-us)
- Contact information for members of your group’s leadership team  


The exact classes student groups choose to advertise in are left up to the group’s leadership, but some recommendations are below:
- Classes in which at least one member of the student group’s leadership is enrolled
  - These are the least effort-intensive option for class shoutouts because you already have someone in the class who is able to do the shoutout!
- Classes taught by the student group’s faculty sponsor
- Classes that cover topics relevant to the student group’s stated mission or activities
  - [Academic Bulletins](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iub/) list all courses offered in a department. (Note that some courses listed in bulletins are inactive or infrequently/irregularly offered)
